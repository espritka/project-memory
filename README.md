## About

This is a project that was assigned from Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Course.
I'm new to javaScript and web pages, so I make a lot of mistakes, if you find one,
please help me make this code better.

## Contributing

If there is anything you would like to teach me, like: how to rewrite this code
to work better, or if you have better idea how to do it, please feel free to help me.
